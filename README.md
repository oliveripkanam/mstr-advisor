  # MSTR/BTC Monitor

  A simple, focused dashboard for watching Bitcoin and MicroStrategy side‑by‑side, plus a handful of useful reads at a glance. No fluff.

  ## What you’ll see

  - Two charts up top
    - BTC on the left, MSTR on the right. Timeframe buttons across the header (1m → 1D).
    - Hit “Compare” to view both charts together and use TradingView’s compare tools.
    - Theme toggle flips everything between dark/light.

  - Quick tiles
    - Mini snapshots for BTC, MSTR, and the MSTR/BTC ratio.
    - The tiny squiggles show recent direction; click a tile to focus that symbol.

  - Perp Funding + OI (BTC)
    - Funding rate with a compact sparkline and open interest context.
    - Reads live from Binance and refreshes automatically.

  - Short‑term Momentum (BTC)
    - A blended take from common indicators (RSI/MACD/ROC) across a few timeframes.
    - Updates regularly and surfaces a simple “how it feels right now”.

  - Support/Resistance + Targets (BTC)
    - Finds nearby levels using swing points, volume hotspots, and simple fibs.
    - Merges confluence, shows distance, a rough probability, and a target in that direction.

  ## How to use it

  - Pick a timeframe in the header; both charts follow.
  - Toggle dark/light if you prefer a different look.
  - Click tiles to switch focus; use Compare when you want both.
  - Skim the cards below the charts for quick positioning—no need to deep dive unless you want to.

  ## Notes

  - Data is kept lean and refreshes quickly. The BTC side uses public endpoints.
  - Signals are intentionally compact—use them as a nudge, not gospel.
  - If anything looks off, refresh the page; it’s meant to be resilient and fast.
